  Gabe of Valve once said computers are the stupidest thing in the world. Well, if a huge fire starts in a room, my guess is that even sheeps would flee, even ants but not a computer (there are exceptions to high end computers that have this ability built-in though). Now, Computer Programming is teaching the stupidest thing in the world how to perform a task that you want it to do for you. Any task, from detonating nuclear WMD, to allowing people view shared media files remotely, to sending messages and files to anyone anywhere, to automating stuffs or merely saying ‘Hello, world’.
